# Hi, I'm Mani Must

Senior Software Engineer with 7+ years of experience building scalable, production-grade systems across backend, frontend, AI/ML and cloud platforms.  
I specialize in designing strong backend architectures, clean frontend experiences and intelligent systems that scale reliably in real-world production.

I enjoy solving complex problems, modernizing legacy systems, leading technical decisions and mentoring engineers while shipping high-impact features.

## What I Do Best

### Backend Engineering
I design and build highly scalable, secure and fault-tolerant backend systems focused on performance, reliability and clean data flow.  
My experience includes API-driven architectures, microservices, event-based systems, background processing, authentication, authorization and large-scale data handling.

I am strong at translating business requirements into clean system designs that work at scale in production environments.

### Frontend Engineering
I build modern, responsive and accessible user interfaces with a strong focus on performance and usability.  
Experienced in building dashboards, admin panels, real-time interfaces and user-facing applications that integrate seamlessly with backend services.

---

### AI / ML & Intelligent Systems
Hands-on experience delivering AI-enabled solutions including applied machine learning, LLM integrations, semantic search, vector-based retrieval systems and data-driven automation.  
I work comfortably across traditional systems and AI-powered workflows, including hybrid architectures.

---

### DevOps & Production Deployment
Strong experience in containerization, CI/CD automation, cloud-native deployments and infrastructure optimization.  
I focus heavily on system stability, observability, security and cost-aware scaling in real production environments.

---

### Technical Leadership & Mentorship
I actively mentor engineers, review architecture designs, improve development workflows and collaborate cross-functionally with product and data teams.  
Comfortable owning features end-to-end from design to deployment.
